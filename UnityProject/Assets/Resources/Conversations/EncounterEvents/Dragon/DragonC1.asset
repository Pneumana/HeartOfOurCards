    so difficult to tell all of you weaklings apart. The lack of importance deems
    the effort required useless in the end. You usually fade into the anals of history
    before accomplishing anything of note, after all.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerResponse1\n!0\n@SAYWe
    won't fade into any anals, o' great dragon. You would do well to remember us,
    as we may be the ones to end your reign.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkDialogue3\n!2\n@SAYJokes
    usually require humor mortals... Your foundationless overconfidence almost matches
    up to your insignificance. You will soon know the folly behind your actions.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice\n!0\n@STAT10|CON|*Withstand

    coersive wave washes over you. You are awed by its might, but you refuse to fall
    here. You must fight this great being. If this were enough to hold you down,
    you wouldn't have come here in the first place.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1Success2\n!2\n@SAYInteresting.
    You remain standing in the face of my great aura. Perhaps you aren't as pitiful
    as those who have come before you...\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYThe
    Dragon looks deeply at you.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1Success3\n!2\n@SAYVery

    has collapsed on top of you. \n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYBlood
    leaks from your seven orifices as you lose all strength in your legs. The Dragon
    towers over you like a looming shadow.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1Fail2\n!2\n@SAYThis
    is your limit, yet you have the audacity to come to this place. Your weakness
    surprises even the Great Black Fang, even when my expectaions of you were so
    low to begin with.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1Fail3\n!2\n@SAYSkitter off and

    Dragon chases after you as you turn to escape. You take turns and duck obstacles
    that the Dragon behind you plows right through. Eventually, you find a doorway
    in a sturdy wall.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2SuccessNarration2\n!3\n@SAYAs you
    jump through the door in the knick of time, the Dragon lunges, but it can only
    manage to fit a mighty paw through the open doorway.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2Success2\n!2\n@SAYLesser
    beings skittering around like the little mice they are. Your end shall be the
    day you run into me once more... If you can survive to that point.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2SuccessNarration3\n!3\n@SAYThe

    debris. You stumble before continuing.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYThe
    hallway takes a turn, but you notice too late to slow down in time, slamming
    into the wall before correcting your direction.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2FailNarration3\n!3\n@SAYA
    pile of rubble blocks your way, and you sturggle to get over it, tear your clothes,
    and scrape your skin. You turn around to see the Dragon slowly following you,
    clearly not taking the chase seriously, and he stops abruptly.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2Fail2\n!2\n@SAYYour
    escape is unbecoming. Finishing you personally would only be a stain to my repuation
    and an honor you don't deserve.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2Fail3\n!2\n@SAYI
    can only let you steep in your foolishness and meet your end at the hands of
    the monsters native to this dungeon.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkEnd4\n!0\n@END Map\n;"
