    lesser beings to fall in the labyrinth... Or have you been here before?

    @SAYIt''s so difficult
    to tell all of you weaklings apart. The lack of importance deems the effort required
    useless in the end. You usually fade into the anals of history before accomplishing
    anything of note, after all.

    won''t fade into any anals, o'' great dragon. You would do well to remember us,
    as we may be the ones to end your reign.

    @SAYJokes
    usually require humor mortals... Your foundationless overconfidence almost matches
    up to your insignificance. You will soon know the folly behind your actions.

    coersive wave washes over you. You are awed by its might, but you refuse to fall
    here. You must fight this great being. If this were enough to hold you down,
    you wouldn''t have come here in the first place.

    You remain standing in the face of my great aura. Perhaps you aren''t as pitiful

    @SAYA wall of powerful
    coercive might washes over you... or maybe it''s just an actual wall. You feel
    like a building has collapsed on top of you.

    is your limit, yet you have the audacity to come to this place. Your weakness
    surprises even the Great Black Fang, even when my expectaions of you were so
    low to begin with.

    off and pray you don''t meet me again. Thank whichever gods you worship that
    a Dragon doesn''t concern himself with mice.

    @SAYThe Dragon chases
    after you as you turn to escape. You take turns and duck obstacles that the Dragon
    behind you plows right through. Eventually, you find a doorway in a sturdy wall.

    you jump through the door in the knick of time, the Dragon lunges, but it can
    only manage to fit a mighty paw through the open doorway.

    hallway takes a turn, but you notice too late to slow down in time, slamming

    @SAYA
    pile of rubble blocks your way, and you sturggle to get over it, tear your clothes,
    and scrape your skin. You turn around to see the Dragon slowly following you,
    clearly not taking the chase seriously, and he stops abruptly.
