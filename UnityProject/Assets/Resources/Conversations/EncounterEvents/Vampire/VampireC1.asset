    is a fan? A miserable little pile of thirst. But enough talk, have at you!\n;\n\nCrowdWorkNarration1\n!3\n@SAYOh,
    right, this is Arc's fan favorite monologue, it's been memed to death. Well,

    you little- we shall see who's panting at the end of this, you rake!\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice1SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYA
    heavy blush fills the vampire's face. Your LOGIC tells you that it would take
    a lot of rizz to make a vampire turn that red!\n;\n\nCrowdWorkEnd1\n!0\n@END

    showing, that\u2019ll get you the oscar for sure. All improv requires quick thinking,

    [Player], were it from anyone else such a bold threat would be trite, tossed

    flat.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2Fail2\n!2\n@SAYTruly, [Player], is that how
    little you care about our moments together? Fine, if you have no care for the
    past, then I shall make you fear our perilous FUTURE.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkPlayerChoice2FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYThe
    grimace on Arc's face is real, the vampire seems hurt. Maybe if you had commited
    to the bit with a little bit of OVERKILL, you could have won the favor of both
    Arc and the crowd.\n;\n\nCrowdWorkEnd4\n!0\n@END Map\n;"
