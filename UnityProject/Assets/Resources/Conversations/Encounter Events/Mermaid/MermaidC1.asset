    @SAYThe
    two of you clash weapons (a spell is a weapon too, it makes a clashing noise
    when Merryreed bats it away with her sword and everything) and dance along the
    planks. You see a stage hand flip a switch backstage, and the terrain you''re
    fighting on splits in half.

    draws her rapier and lunges at you, and you try to parry with your fork. It nearly
    hits your throat but she twists the blade out of the way just in the nick of
    time.

    chases you through the dungeon, the crowd cheers as you two parkour around dangerous
    traps, leap over spiked pits, and duck in between swinging axes. Eventually you
    lose her in a maze of rotating walls.

    @SAYYour
    ENDURANCE really pulled through for this one, a shame you couldn''t map out the
    dungeon, but it''s not like this was a LOGIC test. And hey, that maze led you
    right back to the room you were just in, so at least you didn''t get lost!

    @SAYYou
    run out of breath in a minute, collapsing on your knees. Merryreed catches up
    to you with a dissapointed look on her face. Thankfully, you had the foresight
    to run offstage,so the fans don''t get to see how out of shape you are.
