    match I did, I spent so long working on it...\n@POS 0.5, -0.1, 110\n;\n\nBreakDialogue2\n!2\n@SAYBut
    finding the right spot to cut a word short or throw in an ARRR just makes the
    mollusks in my stomachs tumble around.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue3\n!2\n@SAYOh, right,
    I guess you would call them butterflies in the stomach up here on the surface...\n;\n\nBreakDialogue4\n!2\n@SAYIt
    was hard enough back home.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue5\n!2\n@SAYBut the air pressure
    up here just makes me more aware of all the eyes on me.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue6\n!2\n@SAYPlus
    if I mess up it means it messes with all the others. \n;\n\nBreakDialogue7\n!2\n@SAYI
    really bit off more than I can chew with this thing.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue8\n!2\n@SAYDo
    you ever get nervous on stage [PLAYER]?\n;\n\nBreakDialogue9\n!2\n@SAYOh, what
    am I asking, I'm sure you have at some point.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue10\n!2\n@SAYI
    guess, I meant what do you do to be brave and fight through it?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice\n!0\n@STAT10|INT|\"Two

    best way to get those butterflies to stop fluttering is to tire them out! Do
    some jumping around or some light excercise!\"|BreakPlayerChoice2Success|BreakPlayerChoice2Fail\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success\n!2\n@SAYOh!
    I see what you mean. I can't exactly do breathing excercises, but it's the principal
    right?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success2\n!2\n@SAYFind something you normally
    do without thinking and do it manually and ground yourself to focus your thoughts!\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success3\n!2\n@SAYI
    could do something similar with my fish maw.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success4\n!2\n@SAYNormally
    it just keeps my bouyancy and I forget about it.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success5\n!2\n@SAYBut
    it's technically a muscle I can control...\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success6\n!2\n@SAYThanks
    a lot, [PLAYER], I guess I never thought of it that way...\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYYour
    LOGIC-al understanding of the fundamentals formed a deeper connection with Merryreed!\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1SuccessNarration2\n!3\n@SAYWay
    to help a rookie out!\n;\n\nBreakEnd1\n!0\n@END Map\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail\n!2\n@SAYUh,
    that's three words. Four, if you count the 'and'.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail2\n!2\n@SAYI
    appreciate the help, but since my air is magically provided I'm not really able
    to do breathing excercises in the moment, y'know?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail3\n!2\n@SAYIf
    I ducked my neck down in the nearest water barrel every time I got nervous,\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail4\n!2\n@SAYI
    would only get more embarrased and make more of a mess...\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1FailNarration1\n!3\n@SAYMerryreed's
    underwater adaptation makes the usual methods of stress relief inaccessible.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYMaybe
    with some more LOGIC you could reason out a compatible way to relax her mind!\n;\n\nBreakEnd2\n!0\n@END
    Map\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success\n!2\n@SAYOh! That's an amazing idea!\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success2\n!2\n@SAYI'm
    a pirate after all, so fancy footwork and flourishes aren't all out of the ordinary,
    right?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success3\n!2\n@SAYIt'll also get some crowd work
    in too. Wow, you really are a savant at this!\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success4\n!2\n@SAYHey,
    we've still got some time for break.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success5\n!2\n@SAYWanna
    practice some choreography to help me bounce around a bit more in a fight?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYYou
    had enough VELOCITY in your toes to lead by example.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2SuccessNarration2\n!3\n@SAYMerryreed
    really seems to admire you, and some extra time with her is always great!\n;\n\nBreakEnd3\n!0\n@END

    for me.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail2\n!2\n@SAYI feel queasy enough having to
    jog to work, I don't have my land legs yet.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail3\n!2\n@SAYMaybe
    I should ask Layla.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail4\n!2\n@SAYI mean, she's elegant,
    hot, and makes this whole performing thing look effortless.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail5\n!2\n@SAYMaybe
    she has some tips for me!\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2FailNarration1\n!3\n@SAYLooks
    like Layla gets to steal your personal time with Merryreed.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYMaybe
