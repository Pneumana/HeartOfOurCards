    finding the right spot to cut a word short or throw in an ARRR just makes the
    mollusks in my stomachs tumble around.

    right, I guess you would call them butterflies in the stomach up here on the

    I see what you mean. I can''t exactly do breathing excercises, but it''s the
    principal right?

    @SAYFind
    something you normally do without thinking and do it manually and ground yourself
    to focus your thoughts!

    could do something similar with my fish maw.

    appreciate the help, but since my air is magically provided I''m not really able

    @SAYIf
    I ducked my neck down in the nearest water barrel every time I got nervous, I

    with some more LOGIC you could reason out a compatible way to relax her mind!

    I should ask Layla.

    she''d look up to you more if you were as full of VELOCITY as Layla.
