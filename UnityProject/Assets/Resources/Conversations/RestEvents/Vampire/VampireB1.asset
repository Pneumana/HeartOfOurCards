    keeps cutting costs in the worst ways. I mean seriously, what would my fans think
    if I was drinking basic blood like this?\n@POS 0.5, -0.1, 110\n;\n\nBreakDialogue2\n!2\n@SAYY'know,
    I used to be able to drink fresh blood on stage, straight from the neck. But
    apparently too much blood is a 'biohazard' and one too many stagehands slipped.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue3\n!2\n@SAYIt's
    cheaper to just give me the cheap stuff than medical bills, apparently, they
    care nothing for my complexion.\n;\n\nBreakDialogue4\n!2\n@SAYOh, if only I could
    have a taste of fresh, pure blood from a noble hero who would help a damsel in
    distress...\n;\n\nBreakNarration1\n!3\n@SAYArc is looking at you like a puppy
    forced to take a bath\u2026 How will you get this twink something to quench their
    thirst?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice\n!0\n@STAT10|NRG|*Run to the shop as fast as
    you can to get Arc some virgin blood.*|BreakPlayerChoice1Success|BreakPlayerChoice1Fail|CON|*Offer
    up some of your blood.*|BreakPlayerChoice2Success|BreakPlayerChoice2Fail\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success\n!2\n@SAYVirgin
    blood isn't really my style, but I certainly want to see you run. Really get
    your circulation going.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Success2\n!2\n@SAYGo on, start
    running, I want to hear you pant\u2026 I\u2019ll get you a head start before
    I hunt you down.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYYou start
    booking it, keeping good control of your Velocity to keep Arc always in sight.
    By the time he catches up to you, break time is over, which leaves the vampire
    eager for your next fight.\n;\n\nBreakEnd1\n!0\n@END Map\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail\n!2\n@SAYVirgin
    blood? What am I, a pervert?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1Fail2\n!2\n@SAYGod, virgin
    blood is such boomer vampire energy. Oh what's next, no gay blood, only blood
    on the rocks, shaken not stirred?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice1FailNarration\n!3\n@SAYArc
    leaves, offended by your outdated views. Your lack of VELOCITY in regards to
    undead social issues is really showing, hopefully you have the VELOCITY to run
    away from this PR Scandal.\n;\n\nBreakEnd2\n!0\n@END Map\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success\n!2\n@SAYY'know
    it's been a while since I've had a taste of you. Too long, one might say. Sure,
    I'll have a little taste again, for old times sake.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Success2\n!2\n@SAY
    Mmm, it's not as sweet as before. It's more aged, more complex, with a hint of...
    longing. I have to say, I like this taste a lot more. Drinking blood really cuts
    to the heart of a person, and I think I\u2019ve grown my appreciation for yours.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2SuccessNarration1\n!3\n@SAYIt
    doesn\u2019t hurt that you\u2019ve changed your diet to lower your sugar intake,
    thank goodness for taking care of yourself and your ENDURANCE\n;\n\nBreakEnd3\n!0\n@END
    Map\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail\n!3\n@SAYArc tenderly bites your neck, then
    suddenly bursts into flame, ruining any tender moment you had with them.\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2Fail2\n!2\n@SAYOh
    that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s very spicy. Have you, by chance, had any garlic
    lately?\n;\n\nBreakPlayerChoice2FailNarration2\n!3\n@SAYYou gesture to the bottle
    of garlic oil you've been chugging for the past hour. If only your frail ENDURANCE
    didn\u2019t require an italian diet, you could have hot times with Arc.\n\nBreakEnd4\n!0\n@END
