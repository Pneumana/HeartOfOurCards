    @SAYI caught my accent slipping the last
    warmup match I did, I spent so long working on it...

    @SAYBut
    finding the right spot to cut a word short or throw in an ARRR just makes the
    mollusks in my stomachs tumble around. Oh, right, I guess you would call them
    butterflies in the stomach up here on the surface...

    @SAYIt
    was hard enough back home, but the air pressure up here just makes me more aware
    of all the eyes on me, plus if I mess up it means it messes with all the others.
    I really bit off more than I can chew with this thing.

    @SAYDo
    you ever get nervous on stage [PLAYER]? Oh, what am I asking, I''m sure you have
    at some point. I guess, I meant what do you do to be brave and fight through
    it?

    @SAYOh!
    I see what you mean. I can''t exactly do breathing excercises, but it''s the
    principal right? Find something you normally do without thinking and do it manually,
    and ground yourself to focus your thoughts!

    @SAYI
    could do something similar with my fish maw, normally it just keeps my bouyancy
    and I forget about it, but it''s technically a muscle I can control... Thanks
    a lot, [PLAYER], I guess I never thought of it that way...

    LOGIC-al understanding of the fundamentals formed a deeper connection with Merryreed!
    Way to help a rookie out!

    @SAYUh,
    that''s three words. Four, if you count the ''and''. I appreciate the help, but
    since my air is magically provided I''m not really able to do breathing excercises
    in the moment, y''know?

    @SAYI
    would only get more embarrased and make more of a mess if I ducked my neck down
    in the nearest water barrel every time I got nervous...

    @SAYMerryreed''s
    underwater adaptation makes the usual methods of stress relief inaccessible.
    Maybe with some more LOGIC you could reason out a compatible way to relax her
    mind!

    @SAYOh!
    That''s an amazing idea! I''m a pirate after all, so fancy footwork and flourishes
    aren''t all out of the ordinary, right? It''ll also get some crowd work in too.
    Wow, you really are a savant at this!

    @SAYHey,
    we''ve still got some time for break, wanna practice some choreography to help
    me bounce around a bit more in a fight?

    @SAYYou
    had enough VELOCITY in your toes to lead by example. Merryreed really seems to
    admire you, and some extra time with her is always great!

    @SAYHuh? Oh no, surface
    excercise is not for me, I feel queasy enough having to jog to work, I don''t
    have my land legs yet.

    @SAYMaybe
    I should ask Layla. I mean, she''s elegant, hot, and makes this whole performing
    thing look effortless. Maybe she has some tips for me!

    @SAYLooks
    like Layla gets to steal your personal time with Merryreed. Maybe She''d look
    up to you more if you were as full of VELOCITY as Layla.
