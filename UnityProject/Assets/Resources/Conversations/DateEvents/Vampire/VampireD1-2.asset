    Arc is still in serious danger! How are you protecting him?\n@POS 0.5, 0, 110\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice\n!0\n@STAT10|CON|*Stand
    between Arc and the Vampires, you\u2019ve taken plenty of Arc\u2019s bites before
    so these guys should be lightweights.*|DatePlayerChoice1Success|DatePlayerChoice1Fail|DMG|*Nothing
    like a good offense. Time to put these vampires in their place.*|DatePlayerChoice2Success|DatePlayerChoice2Fail\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success\n!3\n@SAYAs
    you stand between Arc and the vampires, the vampires take a glance at you, sensing
    no opening to strike.. Seeing they\u2019re outmatched, they flee.\r\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success2\n!2\n@SAYOh,
    good, they\u2019re gone. Just when I think my past stays in the past, something
    comes rearing its ugly head to remind me. Those pricks think of me as the next
    lord of the vampires.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success3\n!2\n@SAYWhat a dreadful
    title, and quite regressive. Vampires can walk the night alongside humans these
    days, hand in hand, yet some cocksure brigands still think of your kind as prey\u2026\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success4\n!2\n@SAYI
    thought like them once. I thought it was my unholy right to hurt whomever I pleased
    as long as I was stronger than them. I used it as a tool to justify the hurt
    I was feeling.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success5\n!2\n@SAYI almost pity them.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success6\n!2\n@SAYI
    can\u2019t imagine they were treated much better than I was, and I doubt they\u2019ve
    had someone like you in their lives. Agh, that\u2019s enough of that, though,
    we still have a dinner to attend.\n;\n\nDateEnd1\n!0\n@END Map\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Fail\n!3\n@SAYThe
    vampires lunge at you, immediately going for a gut punch, knocking the wind out
    of you.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Fail2\n!2\n@SAYAh! Good thinking! Operation \u2018Human
    Shield\u2019. You really are making those blows seem convincing, shows how good
    at acting you\u2019ve gotten!\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Fail3\n!2\n@SAYWell I\u2019m
    going to leave you to it, see you at our dinner when you\u2019re done here! Ta~\n;\n\nDateEnd2\n!0\n@END
    Map\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success\n!3\n@SAYWith a decisive blow of your blade
    and/or spell, one vampire is immediately knocked halfway across the city, causing
    the others to flee.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success2\n!2\n@SAYWell, they certainly
    had it coming, still can\u2019t help but feel bad for them. Thanks for your help,
    [Player]. I\u2026 I\u2019m not usually so panicked. I guess old wounds don\u2019t
    really heal.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success3\n!2\n@SAYMy prior master used to
    have his progeny hunt each other down, test our strength, prove our worth. The
    real reason was to make sure we were never strong enough to defeat him.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success4\n!2\n@SAYI\u2019m
    sure myself and those three have come to blows before. It probably will happen
    again too. I think I\u2019ve ruined the mood for dinner, but I\u2019m not sure
    I want to be alone tonight.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success5\n!2\n@SAYCan you
    stay with me, [Player]? At least, until I feel safe?\n;\n\nDateEnd3\n!0\n@END
    Map\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Fail\n!3\n@SAYYour attack goes wild, missing any foe.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Fail2\n!2\n@SAYAh,
    you\u2019ve created an opening! I\u2019ll let you handle these ruffians! Do you
    want anything from the bodega around the corner after the fight?\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Fail3\n!2\n@SAYAh,
    you appear to be getting your ass kicked. I\u2019m going to get you some painkillers
    and a club sandwich, no mayo. Maybe. I think I also have to catch up on Two Piece,
    so many chapters. Bye!\n;\n\nDateEnd4\n!0\n@END Map\n;"
