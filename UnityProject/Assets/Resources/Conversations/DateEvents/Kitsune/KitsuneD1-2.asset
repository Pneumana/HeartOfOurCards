    I didn\u2019t know you were so knowledgeable about all of this.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice1Success2\n!2\n@SAYWell,
    alright then, smartypants. Since you seem to know so much, maybe I can just have

    such an active listener around to listen to my rambling.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success3\n!2\n@SAYThis
    is where I grew up with my parents, so I can tend to get a little long-winded
    when it comes to this place.\n;\n\nDatePlayerChoice2Success4\n!2\n@SAYThis small
    courtyard used to be all there was back then. I was able to expand a lot once
