    Looking at you like this, it seems like you won''t shy away from healing like
    the rest of those would-be adventurers in the making. Seems like I''ll be seeing
    a lot of you after this, fufu.

    ...Have you been hanging out with that Merryreed recently? Anyway, you seem to

    @SAY Well,
    if talking to little ol'' me will help you through this, I suppose I wouldn''t
    mind keeping you company for a while. Go ahead and fire off all those burning
    questions you have for me. Anything that you''re just dying to know, fufu.

    unclench your jaw first. It''s really hard to understand you with that absolute

    Well, I''ve seen people handle it worse, I suppose... And now you''re crying.
    At least you''re not as bad as this one person I treated. They actually cried...
    blood. Maybe I should just stop talking now.
