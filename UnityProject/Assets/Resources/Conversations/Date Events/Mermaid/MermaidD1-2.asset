    @SAYWell, looks like you''re eating
    highly poisonous seafood yet again. How are you tackling it this time while keeping
    your tact?

    do you not like the guts or something? Yum, more for me! Oh, right, you folks

    @SAYWow, down the hatch
    it goes! Isn''t it nice how the barbs deflate right as they pass your lips! It''s
    like getting a backscratch down your throat! I''m so glad you know so much about
    merfolk culture, [PLAYER]!

    @SAYMerfolk
    culture has a lot of superstition based around how you eat your blowfish. If
    you cut it, it''s because you''re looking to share a part of yourself with someone
    else. If you swallow it whole, you''re deeply passionate and devoted to another
    person. I''m glad you feel the same way, [Player]

    @SAYYou take a bite out of
    the fish, but when you chew down a bitter taste floods your mouth. You pass out,
    but awaken on the restaurant floor to Merryreed''s worried look.

    thank goodness you''re awake. I thought you had an allergic reaction or something!
    It''s not like the fish you ate was poisonous... wait, did you pass out from
    shock? Seriously?
